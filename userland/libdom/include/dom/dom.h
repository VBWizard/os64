/* Installs one document into a fresh, idle runtime before evaluation. All
 * three handles are borrowed; state must belong to document. NULL options
 * select the defaults; outcome is required. No runtime/context opaque slot
 * is used. Console output is granted separately by os64_js_install_output.
 *
 * NULL reports failure in outcome. Registration may have published engine
 * objects: destroy that runtime without further evaluation before retrying
 * with a new one. Failed construction clears native opaque pointers and
 * releases its retained engine values before freeing its native storage.
 * This idle installer cannot distinguish engine-cap exhaustion from host
 * allocation failure; evaluation's sticky-limit classification is separate.
 *
 * Native document/control/binding quota refusals throw QuotaExceededError.
 * Invalid tree placement throws HierarchyRequestError; a child/reference
 * mismatch throws NotFoundError; invalid names throw InvalidCharacterError.
 * Wrong receivers and native argument/text errors throw TypeError. During
 * evaluation, engine exhaustion follows libjs's sticky LIMIT/MEMORY contract,
 * not a resumable DOM exception. Retired bindings throw InvalidStateError.
 *
 * Wrappers retain identity and expandos through detach/reinsert and GC.
 * Collections are live objects exposing length, item(index) and indexed
 * access. Child collections omit template contents; innerHTML uses them.
 * Strings replace NUL and lone UTF-16 surrogates with U+FFFD. HTML names are
 * ASCII-folded where their DOM operation requires it.
 * Supported properties/methods live on kind-specific prototype chains;
 * a property absent from a node's chain reads undefined and is absent from in.
 *
 * Content setters stage detached replacements and preflight their insertion
 * before removing current children. A refusal preserves visible children;
 * detached staging remains document-owned until reclamation. Tree methods
 * prepare their return wrappers before making a visible change. Cloning
 * preserves INPUT current value/checkedness and dirty flags, and TEXTAREA
 * current value/dirty flag; other controls initialize from cloned markup. */
